ðŸ”¹ Sample Java Code Snippet (Spring Boot Controller)
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/employees")
public class EmployeeController {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeService employeeService;

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Employee> addEmployee(@RequestBody Employee employee) {
        Employee saved = employeeService.saveEmployee(employee);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(saved);
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Employee> getEmployee(@PathVariable Long id) {
        Employee emp = employeeService.getEmployeeById(id);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(emp);
    }
}
